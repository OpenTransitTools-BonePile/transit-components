Scratch pad for building transit map components in react

 DONE:
   - switch between tilesets
   - configuration + default point and zoom, etc...
   - make a layer control
   - allow config to be injected into this class some way ... maybe via a test app
   - HtmlWebpackPlugin({ with index templ ala MOD and index.html
   - refactor config so that we're not hard-coded to use ../common/config.yml

 TODO:
   d) add search
   e) add overlays (routes)
   f) add vehicles (separate component lib)
   g) localize
   h) make a pan control
   i) clean up the control stuff below: more dynamic (layer names & number button from .yml),
      option to put it in layer switcher or as buttons, etc...
   j) ???
